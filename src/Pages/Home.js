        <h2>Defect Classification</h2>
        <p>
        The system automatically classifies various types of fabric defects, such as tears, color inconsistencies, weave errors, and other imperfections, into specific categories. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and pattern recognition techniques, the system can quickly and accurately categorize defects, enabling manufacturers to take timely corrective actions. This classification not only improves the accuracy of defect detection but also enhances the overall quality control process, making it easier to identify recurring issues and optimize production workflows.

        <h2>Snapshot & Video Analysis</h2>
        <p>
        Snapshot Analysis allows for the rapid inspection of fabric samples by uploading images directly into the system. Once uploaded, the system uses advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms to detect defects such as tears, stains, or weave inconsistencies. This feature enables quick, on-the-spot analysis of fabric quality, ideal for batch testing or quality checks during production.

        Video Analysis extends this functionality by enabling real-time monitoring of fabric production through live video feeds. The system processes the video in real-time, detecting defects as they occur on the production line. This feature is especially useful for continuous production environments, allowing manufacturers to catch defects instantly and prevent defective products from reaching the final stage. Both snapshot and video analysis together provide a comprehensive solution for fabric quality assurance.
